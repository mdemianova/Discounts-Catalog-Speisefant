This is an Android application with a discounts catalog.

The app gets a list of discounts from the server and filters it by categories. 
User can choose to see discounts either by a specific supermarket or by type of product.

With this project, I learned how to use:
- Room library
- SQL select queries
- Retrofit with simple Get requests
- Repository
- DI with Hilt
- ViewPager2
- RecyclerView
- Navigation Component

Aplication has single Activity with MVVM architecture.
